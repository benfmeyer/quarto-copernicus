  \section{Figures and tables in appendices}
  Regarding figures and tables in appendices, the following two options are possible depending on your general handling of figures and tables in the manuscript environment:
  \subsection{Option 1}
  If you sorted all figures and tables into the sections of the text, please also sort the appendix figures and appendix tables into the respective appendix sections.
  They will be correctly named automatically.
  \subsection{Option 2}
  If you put all figures after the reference list, please insert appendix tables and figures after the normal tables and figures.
  
  To rename them correctly to A1, A2, etc., please add the following commands in front of them:
  `\appendixfigures` needs to be added in front of appendix figures
  `\appendixtables` needs to be added in front of appendix tables
  
  Please add `\clearpage` between each table and/or figure. Further guidelines on figures and tables can be found below.

# Results

```{r, echo = FALSE}
sum <- 1 + 41
```

You should always use `echo = FALSE` on R Markdown code blocks as they add formatting and styling not desired by Copernicus.
The hidden workflow results in `r sum`.

You can add verbatim code snippets without extra styles by using ` ``` ` without additional instructions.

```
sum <- 1 + 41
```

## FIGURES

When figures and tables are placed at the end of the MS (article in one-column style), please add \clearpage between bibliography and first table and/or figure as well as between each table and/or figure.

### ONE-COLUMN FIGURES

Include a 12cm width figure of Nikolaus Copernicus from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nikolaus_Kopernikus.jpg) with caption using R Markdown.

```{r, out.width = "8.3cm", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "one column figure"}
knitr::include_graphics("Nikolaus_Kopernikus.jpg")
```

### TWO-COLUMN FIGURES

You can also include a larger figure.

```{r, out.width = "12cm", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "two column figure"}
knitr::include_graphics("Nikolaus_Kopernikus.jpg")
```

## TABLES

You can ad \LaTeX table in an R Markdown document to meet the template requirements.

### ONE-COLUMN TAB

## MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS

All papers typeset by Copernicus Publications follow the math typesetting regulations given by the IUPAC Green Book (IUPAC: Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry, 2nd Edn., Blackwell Science, available at: http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/green_book_2ed.pdf, 1993).

Physical quantities/variables are typeset in italic font (t for time, T for Temperature)

Indices which are not defined are typeset in italic font (x, y, z, a, b, c)

Items/objects which are defined are typeset in roman font (Car A, Car B)

Descriptions/specifications which are defined by itself are typeset in roman font (abs, rel, ref, tot, net, ice)

Abbreviations from 2 letters are typeset in roman font (RH, LAI)

Vectors are identified in bold italic font using $\vec{x}$

Matrices are identified in bold roman font

Multiplication signs are typeset using the LaTeX commands `\times` (for vector products, grids, and exponential notations) or `\cdot`

The character * should not be applied as mutliplication sign

## EQUATIONS

### Single-row equation

Unnumbered equations (i.e. using `$$` and getting inline preview in RStudio) are not supported by Copernicus.

\begin{equation}
1 \times 1 \cdot 1 = 42
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
A = \pi r^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
x=\frac{2b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2c}.  
\end{equation}

### Multiline equation

\begin{align}
& 3 + 5 = 8\\
& 3 + 5 = 8\\
& 3 + 5 = 8
\end{align}

## MATRICES

$$
\begin{matrix}
x & y & z\\
x & y & z\\
x & y & z\\
\end{matrix}
$$

## ALGORITHM/PROGRAMMING CODE

If you want to use algorithms, you need to make sure yourself that the \LaTeX packages `algorithms` and `algorithmicx` are installed so that `algorithm.sty` respectively `algorithmic.sty` can be loaded by the Copernicus template. Both need to be available through your preferred \LaTeX{} distribution. With TinyTeX (or TeX Live), you can do so by running `tinytex::tlmgr_install(c("algorithms", "algorithmicx"))`



Copernicus staff will no accept any additional packages from your LaTeX source code, so please stick to these two acceptable packages. They are needed to use the example below







The conclusion goes here.
You can modify the section name with  `\conclusions[modified heading if necessary]`.
